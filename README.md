# MLCE_OvGU_Tasks
Project Tasks for Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering course at Otto-von-Guericke University

> This project applies theoretical machine learning concepts to the field of chemical engineering, utilizing Jupyter notebooks for task execution. Various algorithms are used to train models, which are then tested to evaluate their performance. The results vary, with some models performing exceptionally well and others less so, providing practical insights into implementing theoretical knowledge.

        Task-1  : Perform KNN regression on BCF dataset.
  
        Task-2  : Use generalized linear model to predict the internal energy.
  
        Task-3  : Use DNN to predict the power output of the CCPP dataset.
  
        Project : Final project task of MLCE-2023 at OvGU.
